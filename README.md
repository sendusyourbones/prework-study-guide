# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was built to collect and display notes taken about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript during the Boot Camp Prework. It provides a single location for all of these notes, while visually differentiating between each topic in a clear way.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Review each named section for information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Open the DevTools console to see the JavaScript in action via messages logged to the console. The JavaScript first lists the four Prework topics, and then it randomly chooses one of the topics to be the first one we study.
